<center><h2>My name story</h2></center>
     <center><p>
          My name is 007, AKA Blue. The story behind these two names is very interesting. Let me tell you! 
         I was given to my current owner two months after staying with my cat family. 
         It was hard to name me for my new owners. 
         My owner's father wanted to call me Trump, but Qiaochu (my new owner) quickly said no.
         She chose the name 007, inspired
         by the Chinese title of the famous movie. She hoped I'd be as quick and clever as the main character, and I think I've lived up to it!
         Another reason is that I was the seventh kitten in my family.
         My nickname Blue came from Qiaochu's dad. 
         Once, during a dinner with a Korean client, he tried to describe my breed but couldn't remember the English term.
         In China, my breed is called a "blue cat" literally, so he just said" I have a blue cat!"
         When he told this story at home, everyone loved that name.
         And now, I have another name--Blue! By the way, I dislike this name. I love what Qiaochu's mom call me: Qiqi.
